# Python-Calculator
Command-line calculator application developed in Python implementing basic arithmetic operations. Demonstrates understanding of functions, user input handling, control flow, and problem-solving in Python.
# Python Calculator with Calculation History

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a Python-based calculator developed as part of a course-level programming assignment. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations and maintains a history of previous calculations. It is a console-based application designed to strengthen programming fundamentals and logical thinking.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Implement a functional calculator using Python
- Extend the calculator to save and display calculation history
- Handle user input errors and invalid operations gracefully
- Practice modular programming using functions

## ⚙️ Features

### Arithmetic Operations
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Power (^)
- Remainder (%)

### Control Operations
- `#` → Terminate the program
- `$` → Reset calculator and return to main menu
- `?` → Display calculation history

## 🧠 Calculation History
- Each operation (operator, operands, and result) is saved in a Python list
- History is displayed in order of execution
- If no calculations exist, the message below is shown:
